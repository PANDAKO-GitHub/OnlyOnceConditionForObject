# "Only Once Condition For Object" GDevelop Extension
This extension is useful if you want to trigger only once per instance.  
This is simpler than creating your own instance variables.

Adding the "Only Once Condition" behavior to an object will add the "Only Once" condition to the instance.  
The condition will be identified by the condition name and will be executed only once.

This condition differs from "Trigger once while true" in that once it is checked, it remains false until reset.
