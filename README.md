# "Only Once Condition For Object" Extension
Adding the "Only Once Condition" behavior to an object will add the "Only Once" condition to the instance.
The condition will be identified by the condition name and will be executed only once.

Unlike the "Trigger once while true" condition, this condition stays true until reset.
